This is a quote that every technologist will say or hear at some point in their career. This is a quote that I want to be part of.
For as long as I can remember I've had the passion to learn, develop and implement skills across a broad range of IT areas.

<br><br> I have recently been intensely studying computer programming at the Institute of Technology Tallaght based in Dublin, Ireland. Having just completed a 7 month work placement program with Fidelity Investments I have attained great knowledge into the working world and gained excellent experience using front end web technologies and software development lifecycle processes.
<br><br>From previous years of study I have amassed a broad knowledge of IT systems, hardware and software components. I am also very familiar with web design and development and possess an excellent understanding of HTML 5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and responsive web design techniques. In my spare time I like write small applications to help me with everyday tasks that I am encountered with.
